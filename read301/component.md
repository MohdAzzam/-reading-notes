# EJS Partials

Partials used when we need to reuse the same html page in more than one view 

--------------------------------------

We create a folder called partials inside the views like the navbar or the footer if they are not change or used in more than one page 

we include the partial inside the **EJS** templating `<%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>`
insted of redundant the code again.
