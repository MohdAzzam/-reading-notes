# Sending form data

Once the form data has been validated on the client-side, it is okay to submit the form

----------------------

## Client/server architecture 

client send request to the server and the server response back to the client with the data 

How the data send from client side to the server side 
The` <form> `element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the `request` to be sent when a user **hits a submit button**. The two most important attributes are `action` and `method`.

How the data is sent depends on the method attribute. 

### The GET method

The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.

### The POST method

The POST method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.


#### On the server side: retrieving the data

Whichever `HTTP method` you choose, the server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs. The way you access this list depends on the development platform you use and on any specific frameworks you may be using with it

-------------------------

## Security issues

Each time you send data to a server, you need to consider security. HTML forms are by far the most common server attack vectors (places where attacks can occur). The problems never come from the HTML forms themselves â€” they come from how the server handles data.

--------------------

## Be paranoid: Never trust your users

So, how do you fight these threats? This is a topic far beyond this guide, but there are a few rules to keep in mind. The most important rule is: never ever trust your users, including yourself; even a trusted user could have been hijacked.

All data that comes to your server must be checked and sanitized. Always. No exception.

Escape potentially dangerous characters. The specific characters you should be cautious with vary depending on the context in which the data is used and the server platform you employ, but all server-side languages have functions for this. Things to watch out for are character sequences that look like executable code (such as JavaScript or SQL commands).
Limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary.

Sandbox uploaded files. Store them on a different server and allow access to the file only through a different subdomain or even better through a completely different domain.
You should avoid many/most problems if you follow these three rules, but it's always a good idea to get a security review performed by a competent third party. Don't assume that you've seen all the possible problems.
