# Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

> I like this way to challange myself when getting starrted with a new project or learn new thing

-----------------------------------------

Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day

-----------------------------------------

You teach people how to treat you.
If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.
But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind

-----------------------------------------

If you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired. Your body and mind long for mastery and freedom; you can’t have those things if your time is cheap and easily taken.
You become what you are

Treat your time as a valuable commodity, and people will begin to treat it like that, too.

`Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things.`

## How to think like a programmer 

> `Problem solving is the meta-skill.`

1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

-----------------------------------------

### Understand

Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

`“If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman`

-----------------------------------------

### Plan

Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

-----------------------------------------

### Divide

`Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.`

-----------------------------------------

### Stuck?

`“The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer`

-----------------------------------------

### Practice 

Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.”

# 5 Whys 

> Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly


The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.

-----------------------------------

### How to Use the 5 Whys

1. Assemble a Team
Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures. 

2. Define the Problem
If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.

3. Ask the First "Why?"
Ask your team why the problem is occurring.
Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
Try to move quickly from one question to the next, so that you have the full picture before you jump to any conclusions.

5. Know When to Stop
You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident.

6. Address the Root Cause(s)
Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

7. Monitor Your Measures
Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.

------------------------------------------- 

### Key Points

> The 5 Whys strategy is a simple, effective tool for uncovering the root of a problem. You can use it in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and quality-improvement initiatives.

> Start with a problem and ask why it is occurring. Make sure that your answer is grounded in fact, and then ask the question again. Continue the process until you reach the root cause of the problem, and you can identify a counter-measure that will prevent it from recurring.

> Bear in mind that this questioning process is best suited to simple or moderately difficult problems. Complex problems may benefit from a more detailed approach, although using 5 Whys will still give you useful insights.
