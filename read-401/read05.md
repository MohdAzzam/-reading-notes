# Linked Lists

A Linked Lists is a sequence of `Nodes` connected to each other.

There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly.

----------------------------------

1. Singly there is one reference to the next node
2. Doubly  form the name there are two reference to the next and Previous  node

3. Node items connected to eachother on the linked list
4. Next property containe ref to the next node
5. Head the first node in the linked list
6. Current the node you are currently on


this is how Linked List look like

----------------------------------

## Linear data structures

We traversal through element sequentially via for loop forEach ..etc

----------------------------------


### Memory management

In Linear data structures we reserved a location in the memory even if we use it or not it's called block memory 

In Linked List we resrved a pointer from the memory like one location to add on it not a block of memory it can grow dynamically
