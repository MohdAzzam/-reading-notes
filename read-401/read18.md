# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

every thing here I qouted from `https://www.serverless.com/amazon-api-gateway`


Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

Many Serverless applications use Amazon API Gateway, which conveniently replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution.

API Gateway sits between the backend services of your API and your APIâ€™s users, handling the HTTP requests to your API endpoints and routing them to the correct backends. It provides a set of tools that help you manage your API definitions and the mappings between endpoints and their respective backend services. It can also generate API references from your definitions and make them available to your users as API documentation.


AWS Lambda: run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
AWS SNS: publish SNS notifications when an HTTP API endpoint is accessed.
Amazon Cognito: provide authentication and authorization for your HTTP APIs.



DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).


reliable performance even as it scales;
a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.


Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familar.


Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. A serverless provider allows users to write and deploy code without the hassle of worrying about the underlying infrastructure. A company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on their computation and do not have to reserve and pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers, as the service is auto-scaling. Note that despite the name serverless, physical servers are still used but developers do not need to be aware of them.
