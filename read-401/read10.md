# Stack Data Structure

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous 

The order of it
1. LIFO Last in first Out 
2. FILO First in last Out

--------------------------

## Queue 

- The fisrt Node Enter should be the  First One Out

- LILO This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

I hope to learn more in our class
