Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”: Ducks is a way to bundle reducers, action types, and actions into the same file.

Rather than splitting up related code, it can be packaged into redux modules. Redux Toolkit’s goal is to help simplify common Redux use cases. It is not intended to be a complete solution for everything you might want to do with Redux, but it should make a lot of Redux-related code you need to write a lot simpler. Redux Toolkit exports several individual functions that you can use in your application, and adds in dependencies on some other packages that are commonly used with Redux.

What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit.
Helps to solve three major problems with Redux: configuring a Redux store, adding numerous packages to get Redux to things, and removing unnecessary or boilerplate code.
