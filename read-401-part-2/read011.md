# Application State with Redux 


What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

Cookies 

Legacy support (it's been around forever)
Persistent data
Expiration dates

Local Storage 
Support by most modern browsers
Persistent data that is stored directly in the browser
Same-origin rules apply to local storage data
Is not sent with every HTTP request
~5MB storage per domain (that's 5120KB)

Third-party cookies.

A cookie placed by any other site, such as an advertiser or social media site, is a third-party cookie.


Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.
