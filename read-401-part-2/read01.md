What’s the difference between a framework and a library?

The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control.

When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.

## Introducing JSX 

`const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;` 

This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML. 


Components : 
Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

separates concerns
Reduce coupling ,increase cohesion 

Coupling : the degree to which each program moudule relies on each other moudules

## Rendering Elements

Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

An element describes what you want to see on the screen
